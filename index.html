        <p><strong>Music Trivia Game:</strong></p>
        <p>This project involved the development of a comprehensive Python-based trivia game, covering multiple decades (90s, 2000s, and 2010s) across three music genres: Rap/Hip-Hop, Country, and R&B. The game dynamically generates questions, assesses user knowledge, and provides immediate feedback on performance.</p>
        <p>One of the key technical aspects of this project was creating a structured and scalable <strong>JSON database</strong> to store quiz questions and answers. I designed the JSON files to categorize questions by genre and decade, ensuring an organized and easily expandable dataset.</p>
        <p>Using Python, I wrote the code to read these JSON files, extract the relevant data, and dynamically generate multiple-choice questions during gameplay. This allowed the quiz to adjust based on the selected genre and decade, ensuring a personalized experience for the player.</p>
        <p>The scoring system was layered to provide feedback and track progress. Users are required to score 80% (12/15 correct answers) to progress to the next decade. Additionally, the code checks and highlights incorrect answers, helping users track areas for improvement. This project not only demonstrates my ability to work with external data sources (JSON) but also integrates <strong>interactive programming</strong> to create a smooth, user-focused experience.</p>
